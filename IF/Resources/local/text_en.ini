105792=My Lord,\nSome skillful workmen have come to the city. If you provide them with a Blacksmith, they will forge powerful equipment for you. Each of them has a unique attribute.\nThe materials needed for forging can be received in the Workshop or by defeating monsters outside the Castle. Let's assemble the troops and hunt them down!
105793=My Lord,\nNow the circumstances have changed and the Peace Treaty has been terminated, which means the "Newbie Shield" has disappeared. But do not fear, my Lord. Train your troops, build your traps to let others know how mighty you are!\nMeanwhile, seeing as you lost your shield, the Traveling Merchant has agreed to give you a special price. He awaits near the city walls. Refresh the goods and find the Premium ones!
105794=My Lord,\nNow you can build the Hall of War, which allows you to assemble your allies and crush anyone who stands in your way!\nAttack is the best form of defense. Since we have already trained enough troops, let's attack our enemies! Don't forget to scout before any battle. A wise Lord never acts rashly.
105795=My Lord,\nYour selflessness removed your people from their suffering. Now it's time to give them faith. Build the Wishing Well to worship the gods, and the gods will grant us an abundance of materials.\nYou may receive many resources in the Wishing Well, but I suggest you wish for Steel, which not only is a necessary resource for forging, but also can't be plundered by other Lords.
105796=My Lord,\nWe have finally established the Trade Routes between you and your allies. As long as you have a Market, you will be able to trade resources with your allies.\nRegarding the Alliance, it's time to carry out your duties. You may help the construction of Alliance Buildings and donate your resources to improve Alliance Science. This will award you Alliance Honor that you can use to buy items in the Alliance Store.
105797=My Lord,\nIt's an inspiring day! Technical advisers from the Chamber of Commerce are teaching our workmen Smelting Technology. We should build Iron Mines to collect Iron now. The woods outside your city seems to be a good place for them.\nNow we are powerful enough to participate in events like "The Dark Knight" and the "Dragon Campaign" in the Event Center.

114139=My Lord: \n Hello! \n The "Clash of Kings" latest version test is finished. Now the "Clash of Kings" project team would like to say thanks to all the players who participated in this test and provided valuable comments and suggestions. These will help us modify and optimize the game to the benefit of everyone. During testing, we've collected your and many other players' comments and suggestions through the in-game feedback system and forum, prompting us to continue our efforts to make the game better. This huge achievement is all due to your tireless support during the beta period! Our team has evaluated the feature feedback you gave this time for quantity and quality and chosen three rewards. However, since you provided too little feedback or the bugs you reported were not verified, you didn't earn any rewards this time. We do look forward to seeing you participate in the next round of testing! \n At the same time, we will officially release the latest version of Clash of Kings to a more global audience and more diverse platforms as soon as possible. We sincerely hope you will stick with us during the game development process so that we can grow together! \n\n The Clash of Kings Team

They are one of the specialties to look out for if you ever do find yourself in that part of the world.\nIn the early days, many Taiwanese snack markets were near the temples. In recent decades, with the development of Taiwan's economy, many large urban department stores arranged snacks on the streets in front of their buildings.\nDue to their unique food culture, Taiwanese snacks are often purchased in some rather unique night markets. At the beginning, many night markets popped up in crowded locations, so most of them are beside temples or busy road intersections. As Taiwan continued to develop, the night markets became common sight and now play an important part in Taiwanese culture.\nTaiwan’s fish balls are one of the most appreciated snacks. Fish balls have a long history in Taiwan. As the snacks developed over time and the selection became more diverse, the fish balls became a specialty of their own: delicious, nutritious and healthy.

150184=<Astérix>  is a famous French comic series written by René Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo.  It made its first appearance in 1959 and has been adapted into movies, games and even a theme park! The comics have been translated into over 110 languages and have sold over 350 million copies worldwide. \nThe story is centered around a small Gaulish village, on the coast of modern day Brittany, a province in Gaul (now France). By 50 BC, Julius Caesar has conquered all of Gaul except for this small enclave, vexing him to no end. Surrounded on all sides by the sea and 4 unlucky Roman garrisons, the villagers are able to resist repeated attempts by the Romans to invade them due to a magic potion brewed by the village druid, Getafix. Asterix, the eponymous hero, is a rather short but fearless warrior known for his cunning and down-to -earth attitude. He is often entrusted with missions on behalf of the villagers and village chief, Vitalstatistix. He goes on the quests armed with the potion that bestows superhuman strength and is almost always accompanied by his closest friend, Obelix. Obelix is a simple-minded menhir sculptor well known for being “big boned” but prefers to refer to himself as well covered or whose chest has “slipped a bit”. Obelix fell into the magic potion during his childhood so he is no longer allowed to drink it, much to his dismay. In one of the stories, the two of them adopt a small dog called Dogmatix.  This smart, nature-loving creature has a short temper and absolutely no sense of direction when it comes to sniffing out a trail. He is usually seen tagging along on the pair's adventures, adding to the mischief and helping them in some situations.\nMy Lord, help the trio collect magic potion to keep their village safe. You can collect 1 to 3 magic potions by attacking Monsters in the Kingdom map. Use the magic potions and receive rewards in exchange.

150198=Pumpkin + Candy = ?
150199=Halloween  is approaching! This festival originates from the Celtic New Years celebration.  2000 years ago, the Celts lived in modern-day Ireland,  England and Northern France. The 1st of November was their New Year. On  the eve, which is the 31st of October, besides celebrating the arrival of a new year, the Celts would also ask for blessings from their ancestors and good-hearted spirits by giving them food offerings.\nHalloween  celebrations used to be simple and were usually held in churches. As  time went on, however, the festival is now a fun-filled day in  which people scare one another and share ghost stories. On Halloween, people dress  up in different sorts of interesting, and sometimes even bizarre, costumes,  and the children go 'trick or treating' by going from house to house knocking on doors and demanding to be treated to candy.\nMy Lord, to celebrate this exciting festival, we have prepared a special in-game Halloween Event! During the Event, terrifying Pumpkin Monsters will appear in the Kingdom Map. Kill them to obtain Evil Pumpkins. When you gather at resource points, you will obtain Candy. Feed the Evil Pumpkins with Candy to obtain Happy Pumpkins.
